**Introduction**

Our group explores the benefits of visualizing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data, highlighting how such visualization facilitates better understanding and management of healthcare information. By employing graphical representations, complex patient data become more accessible and interpretable to healthcare providers, enabling quicker and more informed decision-making. Visualization tools can reveal trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data, aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care optimization. Additionally, visualizing FHIR data supports interoperability and enhances communication among healthcare teams, contributing to improved patient outcomes.
